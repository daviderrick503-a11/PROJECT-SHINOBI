Why do we need classes and objects?
  Organisation and Structure: It helps structure and a program into logical,manageable, and reusable pieces of code
  Reusability: You can use class to create many similar objects without rewriting the code
  Data Bundling: It bundles data and the functions that operate on that data together
  Modeling the real World: It allows you to model real-world entities (like a car , a dog , or a user in a code)

What does the _inti_()function do ?
   The _inti_() function is a special method in python classes that is automatically called when a new object(instance) of the class is created.
Its primary function is to initiate the new object's attributes (to set up their initail state)
